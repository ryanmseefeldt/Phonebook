Purpose: This is the user input program that is used to build the phonebook.

If will allow you the following options:
add contact - This will allow user to add to the phonebook in 3 ways.
  1. add to the beginning of the phonebook
  2. after a specific index entered by the user
  3. at the end of the phone book
remove contact - this will allow user to remove contact either by name or
  by contact number
view contact - This will print the entire contact list.
search - This will search the contact list by (name, address, city, phone
number)
This choice is entered by the user
Edit contact - The user can choose to edit contact by name or contact number.
  Then will be prompted for which field to edit.
Quit - Exit program.
fillbook - hidden command to allow the programmer to fill the phonebook for
testing.
This can be commented out but I left it in so teacher could fill book easier.

Added the ability to enter more than just the number on user
choices.
(ex. for add you can enter 1 or a or add and any variation with capital letters)
